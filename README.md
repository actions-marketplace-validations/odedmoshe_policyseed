# policyseed

Free, offline SOC 2 policy generator. `policyseed` renders 22 governance policy documents
from a single YAML intake file, using a small template engine and zero runtime dependencies.

- **Free and Apache-2.0.** Use it, fork it, modify it, ship it internally or to customers.
- **Deterministic.** The same `intake.yaml` always produces the same Markdown. No randomness.
- **No LLM.** Templates are plain Markdown with a Mustache-style tag syntax, not model output.
- **No signup. No network calls unless you collect evidence.** `build`, `check`, `init`, `list`
  and `mcp` make no network calls and run entirely on your machine or CI runner. `evidence` calls
  only the cloud CLIs you already use (`aws`, `gcloud`, `gh`), with read-only commands, and only
  when you run it.

The policies are a starting point that your company reviews and adopts, not a compliance guarantee. See [What this is not](#what-this-is-not).

## Quick start

Requires Node.js 18 or later. No install step — run it with npx:

```sh
npx policyseed init
# edit intake.yaml with your company's details
npx policyseed build
npx policyseed check
```

- `init` writes a commented `intake.yaml` in the current directory with every field, its
  allowed values, and sensible defaults. It refuses to overwrite an existing file unless you
  pass `--force`.
- `build` reads `intake.yaml`, validates it, and writes all 22 policies to `./policies/` as
  `NN-<slug>.md` files with a company-titled heading.
- `check` reads `./policies/` and `intake.yaml` and exits with status 1 if any policy's last
  reviewed date is older than its `review_cadence` allows. This is what the bundled GitHub
  Action runs on a schedule so an overdue policy shows up as a failing check.
- `list` prints the 22 bundled templates.
- `evidence` collects read-only SOC 2 evidence from AWS, Google Cloud and GitHub with the CLIs
  you already have signed in. See [Collecting audit evidence](#collecting-audit-evidence).
- `--help` and `--version` do what you'd expect.

If you'd rather install it as a dependency:

```sh
npm install --save-dev policyseed
npx policyseed init
```

## Template syntax reference

Templates are plain Markdown files with YAML front matter and a small set of tags, implemented
in [`lib/render.js`](./lib/render.js):

| Tag | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `{{key}}` | Prints the value of `key` from the intake context. Unknown keys render as an empty string. |
| `{{#if key}} … {{/if}}` | Renders the block only when `key` is truthy. |
| `{{#unless key}} … {{/unless}}` | Renders the block only when `key` is falsy. |
| `{{#each list}} … {{/each}}` | Repeats the block once per item in `list`; `{{this}}` is the current item. |

Truthiness matches JavaScript, plus empty arrays count as falsy: `false`, `""`, `0`, `NaN`,
`null`, `undefined` and `[]` are falsy; everything else is truthy.

A block tag that stands alone on its own line (only whitespace before and after it) is removed
together with its line, so conditional paragraphs and loops don't leave stray blank lines
behind. Three or more consecutive blank lines collapse to two.

The context available to every template is built by `toTemplateContext()` in
[`lib/context.js`](./lib/context.js) from your `intake.yaml` — company name, cloud providers,
identity provider, MFA status, data types handled, and so on, plus derived booleans like
`has_mdm`, `has_vendors`, `scope_availability` and `small_team` (headcount 1-10) that templates branch on.

## The 22 policies

| # | Title |
| - | --- |
| 1 | Information Security Policy |
| 2 | Acceptable Use Policy |
| 3 | Access Control Policy |
| 4 | Authentication and Password Policy |
| 5 | Asset Management Policy |
| 6 | Data Classification and Handling Policy |
| 7 | Data Retention and Disposal Policy |
| 8 | Encryption and Key Management Policy |
| 9 | Change Management Policy |
| 10 | Secure Software Development Policy |
| 11 | Vulnerability and Patch Management Policy |
| 12 | Logging and Monitoring Policy |
| 13 | Incident Response Policy |
| 14 | Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Policy |
| 15 | Backup and Recovery Policy |
| 16 | Vendor and Third-Party Risk Management Policy |
| 17 | Risk Assessment and Management Policy |
| 18 | Human Resources Security Policy |
| 19 | Endpoint and Workstation Security Policy |
| 20 | Network and Infrastructure Security Policy |
| 21 | Physical and Remote Work Security Policy |
| 22 | Privacy and Data Protection Policy |

Each one has nine standard sections: Purpose, Scope, Roles and Responsibilities, Policy
Statements, Procedures, Exceptions, Enforcement, Review Cadence, and Revision History.

## Keeping policies current in CI

Use the GitHub Action in a repo that keeps `intake.yaml` and `policies/` under version control:

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
- uses: odedmoshe/policyseed@v1
  with:
    command: check
```

It fails the check when a policy is overdue for review, so a stale policy shows up as a red X
instead of quietly rotting. [`.github/workflows/policy-review.yml`](./.github/workflows/policy-review.yml)
is a complete weekly workflow to copy; inputs and outputs are in
[docs/github-action.md](./docs/github-action.md).

## Use it from an AI assistant (MCP)

`policyseed mcp` starts a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server, so
Claude, Cursor and other MCP clients can list the policies, ask you the intake questions and
render any policy in the conversation. Nothing leaves your machine except what you type to the
assistant.

```sh
claude mcp add policyseed -- npx -y policyseed mcp
```

Claude Desktop and Cursor configuration, the tool list and an example conversation are in
[docs/mcp.md](./docs/mcp.md).

## Collecting audit evidence

Auditors ask for proof that controls are configured: branch protection, MFA, encryption at rest,
logging, who has admin access. `policyseed evidence` gathers that with the `aws`, `gcloud` and `gh`
CLIs you already have installed and signed in, and saves it as dated JSON files plus an index:

```sh
npx policyseed evidence --providers aws,gcp,github \
  --repo acme/app --org acme --project acme-prod
```

```text
evidence/2026-10-23/
  INDEX.md                                 criterion -> file -> what it shows -> auditor question
  CC6.1-aws-iam-account-summary.json
  CC6.1-aws-iam-credential-report.json
  CC8.1-github-branch-protection.json
  ...
```

How it behaves:

- **Read-only.** Every command is a Describe, Get or List call (`gh api` GET requests, no request
  fields). The one exception in name only is `aws iam generate-credential-report`, which asks IAM
  to build the credential report; IAM classifies it as a Read action and it changes no settings.
  `--dry-run` prints the exact commands without running anything; `--list` prints the collectors.
- **No shell.** Each command runs with Node's `execFile` and a fixed argument array. `--repo`,
  `--org`, `--project`, bucket names and trail ARNs are passed as separate arguments, never
  interpolated into a shell string. Pagers and interactive prompts are turned off.
- **Each file** wraps the CLI's JSON output with the command that produced it, the time, the CLI
  version and the exit code. Files are named `<criterion>-<collector-id>.json` after the
  collector's first SOC 2 criterion; INDEX.md lists every criterion a file supports.
- **Redaction.** Before anything is written or printed, values under secret-looking keys
  (`SessionToken`, `SecretAccessKey`, `password`, `token`, ...) are replaced, and so are strings
  that look like credentials: GitHub tokens, AWS access key IDs and session tokens, Google API keys
  and OAuth tokens, JWTs, PEM private keys and `key=value` secrets. Secrets are never requested in
  the first place. Account IDs are kept, because auditors usually need them; pass
  `--redact-account-ids` to truncate 12-digit IDs to their last four digits.
- **Failures don't stop the run.** A missing CLI, missing credentials or a permission error is
  written to INDEX.md as `not collected: <reason>` and the run moves on. The exit code is 1 only
  if nothing at all was collected.
- **Re-runs.** A run replaces the files its providers wrote earlier the same day and rewrites
  INDEX.md. Other days' folders, other providers' files and any files you add yourself (such as
  screenshots) are left alone.
- **Scope.** Regional AWS checks (EBS default encryption, RDS, CloudTrail) use the CLI's
  configured region (`AWS_REGION` or the profile's region). GitHub checks cover one repository and
  one organization; Google Cloud checks cover one project (`--project`, or the gcloud default).
  S3 per-bucket checks stop after `--max-buckets` buckets (default 50). On Windows, `gcloud` is a
  `.cmd` script that Node can't start without a shell, so the Google Cloud collectors report it as
  not collected there.

### What it collects

| Collector | Criteria | Command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `github-repo-settings` | CC7.1 | `gh api repos/{repo}`: default branch, secret scanning and push protection |
| `github-branch-protection` | CC8.1 | `gh api repos/{repo}/branches/{default}/protection` |
| `github-branch-rules` | CC8.1 | `gh api --paginate repos/{repo}/rules/branches/{default}` (ruleset rules) |
| `github-dependabot-alerts` | CC7.1 | `gh api repos/{repo}/vulnerability-alerts` |
| `github-org-2fa` | CC6.1 | `gh api orgs/{org}`: `two_factor_requirement_enabled` |
| `github-org-admins` | CC6.3 | `gh api --paginate orgs/{org}/members?role=admin` |
| `aws-iam-account-summary` | CC6.1 | `aws iam get-account-summary`: root MFA, root access keys |
| `aws-iam-credential-report` | CC6.1, CC6.2 | `aws iam generate-credential-report`, then `get-credential-report`, decoded and reduced to the MFA, password and access-key age columns |
| `aws-iam-password-policy` | CC6.1 | `aws iam get-account-password-policy` |
| `aws-cloudtrail` | CC7.2 | `aws cloudtrail describe-trails`, then `get-trail-status` per trail |
| `aws-ebs-default-encryption` | CC6.1 | `aws ec2 get-ebs-encryption-by-default` |
| `aws-s3-buckets` | CC6.1, CC6.6 | `aws s3api list-buckets`, then `get-bucket-encryption` and `get-public-access-block` per bucket |
| `aws-rds-instances` | CC6.1, A1.2 | `aws rds describe-db-instances`: StorageEncrypted, BackupRetentionPeriod and related fields |
| `gcp-project-iam-policy` | CC6.3 | `gcloud projects get-iam-policy {project}` |
| `gcp-logging-sinks` | CC7.2 | `gcloud logging sinks list` |
| `gcp-sql-instances` | A1.2, CC6.1 | `gcloud sql instances list` (backup configuration) |
| `gcp-compute-disks` | CC6.1 | `gcloud compute disks list` (encryption keys) |
| `gcp-organizations` | CC6.1 | `gcloud organizations list` |

All `aws` commands add `--output json` and all `gcloud` commands add `--format=json`.

### Permissions it needs

Give the identity you run it with read access only.

**AWS.** This policy covers every AWS collector and nothing else:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PolicyseedEvidenceReadOnly",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "iam:GetAccountSummary",
        "iam:GenerateCredentialReport",
        "iam:GetCredentialReport",
        "iam:GetAccountPasswordPolicy",
        "cloudtrail:DescribeTrails",
        "cloudtrail:GetTrailStatus",
        "ec2:GetEbsEncryptionByDefault",
        "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
        "s3:GetEncryptionConfiguration",
        "s3:GetBucketPublicAccessBlock",
        "rds:DescribeDBInstances"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Google Cloud.** `roles/viewer` on the project covers the project collectors, and
`roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer` on the organization covers `organizations list`.
For narrower access, grant `roles/iam.securityReviewer` (IAM policy), `roles/logging.viewer`
(sinks), `roles/cloudsql.viewer` (SQL instances) and `roles/compute.viewer` (disks) on the project.

**GitHub.** `gh` uses whatever it is signed in with (`gh auth login`, or `GH_TOKEN`). Repository
admin read access is needed for classic branch protection, the `security_and_analysis` block and
the Dependabot alerts setting; the ruleset rules need only read access. For the organization,
GitHub returns `two_factor_requirement_enabled` only to organization owners, and lists private
members only to members. A fine-grained token with repository *Administration: read* and
*Metadata: read* and organization *Members: read* covers the rest. A collector the token can't
read is recorded as not collected, never as a pass.

To run the GitHub collectors on a schedule and keep the results as a workflow artifact, see
[docs/evidence.md](./docs/evidence.md).

### What it does not do

It saves configuration as it is on the day you run it. It doesn't judge whether that
configuration meets your policies, it doesn't cover every control an auditor will test, and it
doesn't replace the auditor's own testing: they will choose their own samples, may ask you to
re-run commands while they watch, and will test whether the controls operated over the whole
audit period.

## Relationship to the hosted generator and Audit Kit

This package is the same rendering engine that powers the hosted generator at
[policyseed.io](https://policyseed.io), packaged for people who'd rather run it
locally, script it into CI, or read exactly how it works; the hosted site also offers a paid
Audit Kit that uses Claude to tailor the Policy Statements and Procedures sections to your
specific stack and adds export formats — this CLI does not include that tailoring step.

## What this is not

These are governance document templates, not legal advice, and not a compliance guarantee. A SOC 2
report is an independent CPA firm's opinion, and it depends on whether you actually operate the controls these policies describe — access reviews happening on
schedule, incidents actually being logged and triaged, backups actually being tested — not just
on having the documents. Have a qualified person (counsel, an auditor, or an experienced
compliance practitioner) review the output before you rely on it externally.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome at
[github.com/odedmoshe/policyseed](https://github.com/odedmoshe/policyseed). If you're proposing
a change to a policy's wording, prefer editing the template's prose directly and running the
test suite (`node --test test/`) so the renderer parity and CLI smoke tests still pass. If
you're adding a new intake field, update `lib/context.js` (`DEFAULT_INTAKE`,
`toTemplateContext`, `validateIntake`) together, since the three are meant to stay in lockstep.
