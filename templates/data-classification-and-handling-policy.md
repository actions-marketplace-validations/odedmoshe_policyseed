## 1. Purpose

Not all information needs the same protection, and treating everything as top secret is as unworkable as treating nothing that way. This policy gives {{company}} a four-level classification scheme and states, for each level, where data may be stored, how it may be transmitted, who it may be shared with, and how it is disposed of. It tells an engineer whether a dataset can go into staging and a salesperson whether a document can be emailed to a prospect.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all personnel of {{company}} and to all information that {{company}} creates, receives, stores or processes in any form, including data held in {{cloud}}, in {{scm}}, in business applications{{#if has_vendors}} such as {{vendors}}{{/if}}, on endpoints, in backups and logs, and on paper. It covers the customer data that {{product}} processes{{#if has_sensitive_data}}, which includes {{data_types}} data,{{/if}} as well as internal business information, personnel records, source code and security records. {{#if scope_confidentiality}}Because Confidentiality is within the scope of the SOC 2 examination, it also defines how {{company}} identifies and protects information subject to confidentiality commitments.{{/if}}

## 3. Roles and Responsibilities

- **Executive Management** ({{approver}}) approves this policy and the classification scheme, and approves any external disclosure of Restricted information not already covered by a customer agreement.
- **Security Owner** ({{security_owner}}) owns this policy, maintains the data inventory, decides classification where it is unclear, approves external sharing of Confidential and Restricted information, and monitors compliance.
- **Engineering** implements the technical handling controls in {{cloud}} and {{product}}: encryption, access restrictions, classification tags, separation of production and non-production data, and secure deletion.
- **People Operations** classifies and protects personnel records, and includes classification and handling in onboarding and annual training.
- **All Personnel** classify information they create, handle it according to its level, apply the stricter level when in doubt, and report suspected mishandling to {{incident_contact}}.

## 4. Policy Statements

- **4.1** {{company}} classifies information into four levels. **Public** is approved for release to anyone. **Internal** is routine business information whose disclosure would cause limited harm. **Confidential** is information whose disclosure would harm {{company}}, its personnel or its partners, such as financial records, contracts, personnel data, source code and security configurations. **Restricted** is information whose disclosure would seriously harm customers or {{company}} or breach a legal or contractual obligation, including all customer data processed by {{product}}{{#if has_sensitive_data}}, all {{data_types}} data{{/if}}, credentials and encryption keys, and security incident details.
- **4.2** The person who creates or first receives information classifies it; where unclear, the higher level applies until the Security Owner decides. Aggregations of Internal information that together reveal Confidential or Restricted facts take the higher level. Restricted and Confidential documents are labeled where the format allows, and systems holding Restricted data are tagged in the asset register and in {{cloud}}.
- **4.3** Restricted and Confidential information is stored only in systems the Security Owner has approved for that level and recorded in the data inventory. Customer data is stored only in the production environment of {{product}} in {{cloud}} and its managed backups, never on endpoints, in chat or tickets, in personal storage or in unapproved SaaS tools.
- **4.4** Restricted information is encrypted at rest and in transit under the Encryption and Key Management Policy. Confidential information is encrypted in transit and, on endpoints or removable media, at rest. Encryption does not replace the access restrictions in the Access Control Policy.
- **4.5** Access to Restricted information is limited to individuals with a documented need, granted under the Access Control Policy, reviewed quarterly and logged{{#if has_logging_tool}} in {{logging_tool}}{{/if}}. Access to Confidential information is limited to the teams that need it for their work.
- **4.6** Production customer data is not copied into development, staging, test or analytics environments. Where realistic data is needed, Engineering uses synthetic data or data irreversibly anonymized through a process approved by the Security Owner.
- **4.7** Confidential and Restricted information is shared externally only with a party under a signed agreement with confidentiality terms, through approved channels with encryption and access control, with the minimum content required, and with the information owner's approval; Restricted information additionally requires Security Owner approval unless it is being returned to the customer who owns it through {{product}}. Public links, open shares and personal email are never used for these levels.
- **4.8** {{#if has_pii}}Personal data is collected only for the purposes in the privacy notice of {{company}}, limited to what those purposes require, not repurposed without a lawful basis, and handled under the Privacy and Data Protection Policy. Requests from individuals to access, correct or delete their data are routed to the Security Owner within one business day.{{/if}}{{#unless has_pii}}Any personal data {{company}} incidentally holds, such as contact details of customer users, is treated as Confidential, limited to what the business relationship requires, and handled under the Privacy and Data Protection Policy.{{/unless}}
- **4.9** {{#if has_phi}}Protected health information is Restricted, is processed only within the boundary described in the applicable business associate agreements, is never sent by email or chat, is accessed only by personnel who have completed health data handling training, and is logged on every access. {{company}} does not use it for product development, analytics or marketing.{{/if}}{{#unless has_phi}}{{company}} does not knowingly process protected health information. Any proposal to send health data through {{product}} is escalated to the Security Owner and Executive Management, who decide what controls and agreements are required before it is accepted.{{/unless}}
- **4.10** {{#if has_payment}}Payment card data is Restricted. {{company}} delegates card capture, storage and processing to a certified payment processor; full card numbers, security codes and chip or stripe data are never stored, logged or displayed by {{product}} or handled by personnel, and only tokens and the last four digits are retained.{{/if}}{{#unless has_payment}}{{company}} does not process payment card data directly, and any future card acceptance is designed so that card data is handled only by a certified payment processor and never enters the systems of {{company}}.{{/unless}}
- **4.11** Information is retained only as long as the Data Retention and Disposal Policy requires and is then securely deleted, wiped or shredded. Customer data is deleted or returned at the end of the relationship on the timeline in the customer agreement.
- **4.12** {{#if scope_confidentiality}}Information that {{company}} has agreed to keep confidential under a customer agreement, non-disclosure agreement or partnership is identified when the agreement is signed, recorded in the data inventory against the agreement, classified as Restricted or Confidential according to its terms, and protected for the duration the agreement requires, even after the relationship ends.{{/if}}{{#unless scope_confidentiality}}Information received from customers, partners or prospects under a non-disclosure agreement is classified as Confidential at minimum, recorded in the data inventory against the agreement, and protected for the duration the agreement requires.{{/unless}}

## 5. Procedures

- **5.1** Data inventory. The Security Owner maintains an inventory of the significant datasets and data stores of {{company}}, recording for each its description, classification, owner, hosting system, whether it contains {{#if has_sensitive_data}}{{data_types}} data{{/if}}{{#unless has_sensitive_data}}personal or regulated data{{/unless}}, retention period and any contractual confidentiality obligation. It is updated at each quarterly access review and whenever a new data store is introduced.
- **5.2** Classifying a new dataset or system. Before a new data store, integration or SaaS tool receives company or customer data, the requester describes the data to the Security Owner, who assigns the level, records it in the data inventory and asset register, and confirms the system meets the requirements for that level. Engineering applies the corresponding tags in {{cloud}}.
- **5.3** External sharing. A person who needs to share Confidential or Restricted information externally raises a request naming the recipient, the agreement covering them, the content and the channel. The information owner approves Confidential sharing; the Security Owner additionally approves Restricted sharing. The approved channel is limited to named recipients, with expiring links where supported, and the request is retained as evidence.
- **5.4** Non-production data. Engineering documents the source of data in every non-production environment. Where production-like data is genuinely needed, the requesting engineer proposes an anonymization or synthesis method, the Security Owner approves it, and the resulting dataset is recorded in the inventory as Internal. Production credentials are never present in non-production environments.
- **5.5** Restricted data access logging. Engineering ensures that access to production customer data stores is logged with identity, time and action{{#if has_logging_tool}} in {{logging_tool}}{{/if}}, and the Security Owner samples those logs monthly against approved tickets and incidents. Unexplained access is investigated within two business days.
- **5.6** Quarterly exposure checks. The Security Owner reviews externally shared files and public links in {{#unless idp_none}}{{idp}} and the applications federated to it{{/unless}}{{#if idp_none}}the company document and email platforms{{/if}}, checks storage on {{cloud}} for publicly readable buckets or objects, and reviews {{scm}} for repositories whose visibility does not match their classification. Findings are corrected within five business days and recorded.
- **5.7** Customer data requests. Requests from customers to export, correct or delete their data are logged on receipt, verified as coming from an authorized customer contact, executed by Engineering within the timeline in the customer agreement or applicable law, and confirmed in writing. Deletion covers primary storage and, on the backup rotation schedule, backups.
- **5.8** Mishandling response. Misdirected or exposed information is reported to {{incident_contact}} immediately; prompt self-reporting is never penalized. The Security Owner confirms the classification, works with the sender to recall or delete it, assesses whether customer or regulatory notification is required under the Incident Response Policy, and records the event and corrective action.

## 6. Exceptions

Exceptions, such as temporarily holding Confidential information in an unapproved tool during a migration, are approved in writing by the Security Owner, recorded in the exception register with compensating controls and an expiry date no later than twelve months out, and reviewed at each {{review_cadence_lc}} review. Exceptions affecting Restricted information additionally require approval from {{approver}}. No exception permits customer data in personal accounts or unapproved AI tools, or un-anonymized production data in non-production environments.

## 7. Enforcement

Information found outside the systems approved for its classification is removed or secured as soon as it is discovered. Personnel who share Confidential or Restricted information without approval, copy customer data to unapproved locations, or ignore the handling rules are subject to the disciplinary process in the Acceptable Use Policy, up to and including termination. Deliberate exfiltration of customer data is escalated to Executive Management immediately and may be referred to law enforcement.

## 8. Review Cadence

The Security Owner reviews this policy at the {{review_cadence_lc}} policy review, after any incident involving data exposure, and whenever {{company}} begins processing a new category of data or changes the scope of its SOC 2 examination. Revisions are approved by {{approver}} and recorded in section 9.
